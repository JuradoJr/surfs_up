## Overview of the analysis:
The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze the different temperatures in Oahu on the months of June and December. This will help us determine whether it would be a good and profitable decision to have a surf shop operate throughout the year. 
 

## Results:

- For December we find that there are 1,517 recorded temperatures with the average temperature being 71. A minimum of 56.0 and a maximum of 83.0. The standard deviation is also 3.75.


- From both monthâ€™s datasets we notice that there is only a 0.5 difference in standard deviations and that the average temperature tends to be only slightly cooler in December. 


## Summary:
We can see that temperature will not drastically change between summer and winter but two more queries that would be beneficial to know could be such as the precipitation or rain that specific month is expected to have and also the amount of visitors go to the area where the surf shop will be located at. That way we can determine if rain will affect the business and also if customers tend to visit beach areas more towards the summer than the winter, that way in the worst case scenario, we can be prepared to have lonely winters in the shop.
